# SPA fallback for client-side only routes (not pre-rendered by SSG)
# SSG-rendered pages (/, /about, /faq, /blog/*, /guides/*, etc.) are served
# directly as static HTML files by Netlify — no redirect needed.

# Client-side only routes (lazy-loaded, not pre-rendered)
/dashboard          /index.html        200
/admin              /index.html        200
/checkout           /index.html        200
/auth/*             /index.html        200
/courses/:id        /index.html        200

# Final SPA fallback — only fires if no static file exists at the path
/*                  /index.html        200
